On arch linux it seems that pycharm installed from snapd has issues

When clicking a text file generated by a python program

If right click, the pop menu's "open with" option disappeared

If double click, there is no response, but the computer is starting to be busy with disk operation, you can clearly hear the noise


There is no hint what has gone wrong

Now the fix is uninstalling snapd and all its installations

Install them using pacman or yay

htop shows that 2 processes(xdg-open and kde-open5) are too busy forking themselves
